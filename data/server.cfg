// This line sends the following data to our servers:
// - Date and time
// - Your server IP address
// - Your server ID hash, which is a fingerprint of the public key of your
//   server and does not impact security of your private key (use "crypto_keys"
//   on the console to show it)
// - Your server name ("hostname")
// - Current game type
// - Current map
// - Balance settings you have modified from defaults (only those that make
//   your server "impure")
// - For each weapon pairing (A, B), separately for player-player, player-bot,
//   bot-player, bot-bot pairings:
//   - Number of hits of players/bots holding A against players/bots holding B
//   - Number of frags of players/bots holding A against players/bots holding B
//   - Total damage of players/bots holding A against players/bots holding B
//
// We use this data to:
// - Optimize the game balance for future releases
// - Identify problems in the bot AI and improving it
// - Find settings that make servers "impure" that should not, so we can
//   whitelist them in future releases
//
// We will or might publish:
// - Global weapon pairing statistics for players vs players, or bots vs bots,
//   or any vs any, on a selection of servers
// - Per-gametype and per-map weapon pairing statistics players vs players, or
//   bots vs bots, or any vs any, on a selection of servers
// - Lists of commonly changed cvars, together with counts on how often they
//   are modified
//
// No information about the players on the server is sent, so as a server admin
// you need no permission of your players for this.
//
// No information about your server will be published - all published data sets
// will include data from multiple servers.
